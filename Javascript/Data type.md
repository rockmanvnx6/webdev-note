# Data Type

like C, we also have:

**Bollean**:

`true` and `false`

**NULL**:

if you want an variable to be empty but not undefined. You set the value to `null`.

`var empty = null`

**Undefined**

if you create an variable and don't set it to anything, it will become undefined.

`var empty`

if you want to know what data type a variable has:

`console.log(typeof variable_name);`

> notice when you `typeof empty` it will return **object**. This is an error of the browser itself. Because it's empty. It treats it as an object.

# Blocks

block is the block of code:

```ruby
test {
    statement1
    statement2
    statement3
    }
```



inorder to execute codes in block `test`. we need a function test

```ruby
def test
    
end
```

in function test, we will need to **yield** inorder to make the codes in test executed:

```ruby
def test
    puts "you're in method"
    yield
end

test {
    puts "you're in block"
}
```

> you're in method
> you're in block



So the method will be executed first and then the block will be executed.

**Another way**

is to callback the block

```ruby
def test(&block)
    block.call
end

test {
    puts "hi, everyone"
    }
```



## passing parameters into blocks

```ruby
def test
    puts "you're in method"
    yield 5
end

test {
    |i| 
    puts "you're in block #{i}"
}
```

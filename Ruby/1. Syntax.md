# Print something out of the screen

```ruby
print "hi"
```

or

```ruby
puts "hi"
```



## Different between print and puts.

Puts will add the `\n` in the end.

Print does not.

Puts = println.

**We can do **

```ruby
puts ("some text" + variable + "another text")
```

variable has to be a string.

if it's not a string then

```ruby
puts ("some text" + variable.to_s + "another text")
```



# To run your first program:

```bash
ruby test.rb
```



## Whitespace

- generally ignored.

# Identifiers

- Case sensitive,
- Variable APPLE and apple are different

## Begin and End Statement

The **Begin** statment will be executed in the begin of the program.

The **End** statement will be executed in the end of the program.

```ruby
END{
    puts "program shutting down"
}
BEGIN {
    puts "program initializing.."
}
puts "1+1 = 2"
```

> program initializing..
>
> 1+1 = 2
>
> program shutting down

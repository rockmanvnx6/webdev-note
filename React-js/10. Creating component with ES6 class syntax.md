# Creating component with ES6 class syntax

In the previous chapter, we have been creating component by following:

```react
export const SkiDayCount = React.createClass({
    something{
    
	},
    another_thing{
                                             
   },
})
```

In ES6, There are a few change.

First. we don't need the `,` between each `{}` anymore since we don't use `({})` anymore.

use `export class` instead

```react
export class SkiDayCount extends React.Component{
    something{
        
    }
	another_thing{
    
	}
}
```



or to short hand

```react
import {Component} from 'react'

export class SkiDayCount extends Component{
    something{
        
    }
	another_thing{
    
	}
}
```

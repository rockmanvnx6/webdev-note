# React Router

> Is to change the website quickly without reloading.



## Installation

```bash
npm install react-router@3.0.0 --save
```



## Setup

In `index.js`

```react
import { Router, Route, hashHistory} from 'react-router'

render(
	<Router history={hashHistory}>
        <Route path="/" component={App}/>
        <Route path="*" component={Whoops404}/>
    </Router>,
    document.getElementById('react-container')
)
```



So whenever any one goes to the home, it will render `/App`. Anything else will be `Whoops404` - which is a 404 page.

`history = {hashHistory}` will listen to the address bar to see if there is any changes.

Of course don't forget to

```react
import { App } from './components/App'
import { Whoops 404 } from './components/Whoops404' 
```

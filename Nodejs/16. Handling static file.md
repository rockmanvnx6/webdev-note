# Handling static file

**Put every static files in to `assets` folder**

Now in order to make it works with ejs, we need to fire a get request when user requesting those files.

```js
var express = require('express')
var app = express();

app.use('/assets', express.static('assets'));
```

**Format:**`` app.use(‘routename', express.static(‘foldername'));``

Now every static file will work.

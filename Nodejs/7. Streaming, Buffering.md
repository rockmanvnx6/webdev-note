# Streaming, Buffering, Pipe

> The idea of streaming and buffering is taking small chunk of input and pass it to the data instead of taking the whole input in the same time

## Read Stream

```javascript
var myReadStream = fs.createReadStream('filename.txt');
```

To print out:

```javascript
myReadStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk);
})
```

><Buffer 74 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 74 68 65 20 66 69 72 73 74 20 6c 69 6e 65 0a 0a 6f 6b 20 63 6f 6f 6c>



**To print the actual value, have to specify the format in ReadStream**

```javascript
var myReadStream = fs.createReadStream('filename.txt', 'utf8');
```

```javascript
myReadStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk);
})
```



## To write stream

```javascript
var myWriteStream = fs.createWriteStream('filename.txt');
```

To write

```javascript
myWriteStream.write(chunk, err=> {
    if(err) console.log(err);
})
```

The first argument takes a chunk data type. in which we can get chunk from `myReadStream`



So:

```javascript
var myReadStream = fs.createReadStream('readme.txt', 'utf8');
var myWriteStream = fs.createWriteStream('writeme.txt');
myReadStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk);
    myWriteStream.write(chunk, err => {
        if(err) console.log(err);
    })
})
```

Doesn't necessary need to be `utf8`, can do like

```javascript
var myReadStream = fs.createReadStream('readme.txt');
var myWriteStream = fs.createWriteStream('writeme.txt');
myReadStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk);
    myWriteStream.write(chunk, err => {
        if(err) console.log(err);
    })
})
```

# Pipe

### Syntax

`source.pipe(output)`

Instead of reading, taking the data and then pass it in the Write stream, we can just simply use pipe, which does the whole process for us.

```javascript
myReadStream.pipe(myWriteStream)
```

this is equals to

```javascript
myReadStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk);
    myWriteStream.write(chunk, err => {
        if(err) console.log(err);
    })
})
```

**Piping can only use at readStream**



Sooo what you put in pipe is the ==output== of the file that you want the content to be.



**In this way, we can display the file's content to the server by:**

```javascript
var myReadStream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/readme.txt', 'utf8');


var server = http.createServer((req,res) => {
    console.log(req.url);
    res.writeHead(200, {
        'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
    });
    myReadStream.pipe(res);

});

```

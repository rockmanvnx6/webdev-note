# Query String

Query string is when you visiting an url with the format of `localhost.com/contact?person=`==austin==

**Requirement:**

express and app

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
```



**How to use?**

Let say you want route `/contact` to take a query

```js
app.get('/contact', (req,res) => {
    res.render('contact', {
        query: req.query
    })
})
```

In here req.query will return whatever format the user request in the URL.

say if the user visiting: localhost.com/contact?person=Austin&id=9

`console.log(req.query)` 

```js
{
    person: 'Austin',
    id: '9'
}
```

In here, we passed req.query as `query` to contact view.



**To call**

in contact.ejs, can call by:

`<%= query.person %>`

or even

```ejs
<input type="text" value="<%=query.receiver%>"/>
```

if the url is localhost.com/contact?person=Austin
